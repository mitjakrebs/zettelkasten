* Formal statement
Given an undirected demand graph \(G\) and an integer \(k\), deciding whether there is a binary tree \(H\) such that the shortest weighted path length is at most \(k\) is NP-hard [cite:@buzdalov2024search].

* Proof sketch
The proof is via reduction from the minimum linear arrangement (MLA) problem.
Starting with an instance \(G'\) of MLA, we construct demand graph \(G\) by augmenting \(G'\) with a line \(L\) that has high demands.
The endpoints of \(L\) are connected to each vertex in \(G'\).
The idea is to enforce that \(H\) is a caterpillar with \(L\) forming its spine and the vertices of \(G'\) as its leaves.
